    "`xarray-leaflet` has two modes, one is for static maps and the other for dynamic maps. By dynamic we mean that you won't see the same thing depending on the current map view. For instance, if you zoom in you might want to show details that would otherwise be hidden. So the map really adapts to where you look on the Earth. The downside of dynamic maps is that you will see more flickering as you interact with the map, because tiles have to be refreshed as soon as you drag or zoom.\n",

The default transformation for this stage does exactly that, so if you don't want to add any transformation at this stage, just don't redefine it. In this example, we will keep the default transformation for the static mode, and have our own normalization in the next stage for the dynamic mode.\n",
